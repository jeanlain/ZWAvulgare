Scripts used in "Characterization of a sex-determining region and its genomic context via statistical estimates of haplotype frequencies in daughters and sons sequenced in pools" (submited)

Richard Cordaux, Mohamed Amine Chebbi, Isabelle Giraud, David Pleydell and Jean Peccoud

The scripts are not a ready-to-use piece of software to investigate sex chromosomes in other species.
They are provided to document our method.
Not every step of the pipeline was scripted.

Scripts starting with numbers were run (from an R console) in that ordrer.
The other provided scripts were sourced from the numbered scripts.
